# HISTCONTROL
#   bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell
#
# A colon-separated list of values controlling how commands are saved on the
# history list.  If the list of values includes ignorespace, lines which begin
# with a space character are not saved in the history list.  A value of
# ignoredups causes lines matching the previous history entry to not be saved.
# A value of ignoreboth is shorthand for ignorespace and ignoredups.  A value of
# erasedups causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed
# from the history list before that line is saved.  Any value not in the above
# list is ignored.  If HISTCONTROL is unset, or does not include a valid value,
# all lines read by the shell parser are saved on the history list, subject to
# the value of HISTIGNORE.  The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line
# compound command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of
# the value of HISTCONTROL.
HISTCONTROL="ignoreboth"

# HISTFILESIZE
#   bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell
#
# The maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When this variable
# is assigned a value, the history file is truncated, if necessary, to contain
# no more than that number of lines by removing the oldest entries.  The history
# file is also truncated to this size after writing it when a shell exits.   If
# the value is 0, the history file is truncated to zero size.  Non-numeric
# values and numeric values less than zero inhibit truncation.  The shell sets
# the default value to the value of HISTSIZE after reading any startup files.
HISTFILESIZE="2000"

# HISTSIZE
#   bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell
#
# The number of commands to remember in the command history (see HISTORY below).
# If the value is 0, commands are not saved in the history list.   Numeric
# values less than zero result in every command being saved on the history list
# (there is no limit).  The shell sets the default value to 500 after reading
# any startup files.

# LESS
#   less - opposite of more
#
#   Options which are passed to less automatically
#
# -I or --IGNORE-CASE
#   Like -i, but searches ignore case even if the pattern contains uppercase
#   letters.
#
# -R or --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS
#   Like -r, but only ANSI "color" escape sequences are output in "raw" form.
#   Unlike -r, the screen appearance is maintained correctly in most cases.
#   ANSI "color" escape sequences are sequences of the form:
#
#     ESC [ ... m
#
#   where the "..." is zero or more color specification characters For the
#   purpose of keeping track of screen appearance,  ANSI color escape sequences
#   are assumed to not move the cursor.  You can make less think that characters
#   other than "m" can end ANSI color escape sequences by setting the
#   environment variable LESSANSIENDCHARS to the list of characters which can
#   end a color escape sequence.  And you can make less think that characters
#   other than the standard ones may appear between the ESC and the m by setting
#   the environment variable LESSANSIMIDCHARS to the list of characters which
#   can appear.
#
# -xn,... or --tabs=n,...
#   Sets tab stops.  If only one n is specified, tab stops are set at multiples
#   of n.  If multiple values separated by commas are specified, tab stops are
#   set at those positions, and then continue with the same spacing as the last
#   two.  For example, -x9,17 will set tabs at positions 9, 17, 25, 33, etc.

# XZ_OPT
#   xz, unxz, xzcat, lzma, unlzma, lzcat - Compress or decompress .xz and .lzma
#   files
#
# This is for passing options to xz when it is not possible to set the options
# directly on the xz command line.  This is the case e.g. when xz is run by a
# script or tool, e.g. GNU tar(1):
#
#   XZ_OPT=-2v tar caf foo.tar.xz foo
#
# Scripts may use XZ_OPT e.g. to set script-specific default compression
# options.  It is still recommended to allow users to override XZ_OPT if that is
# reasonable, e.g. in sh(1) scripts one may use something like this:
#
#   XZ_OPT=${XZ_OPT-"-7e"}
#   export XZ_OPT
#
# -T threads, --threads=threads
#   Specify the number of worker threads to use.  Setting threads to a special
#   value 0 makes xz use as many threads as there are CPU cores on the system.
#   The actual number of threads can be less than threads if the input file is
#   not big enough for threading with the given settings or if using more
#   threads would exceed the memory usage limit.
#
#   Currently the only threading method is to split the input into blocks and
#   compress them independently from each other.  The default block size depends
#   on the compression level and can be overriden with the --block-size=size
#   option.
#
#   Threaded decompression hasn't been implemented yet.  It will only work on
#   files that contain multiple blocks with size information in block headers.
#   All files compressed in multi-threaded mode meet this condition, but files
#   compressed in single-threaded mode don't even if --block-size=size is used.
